\begin{abstract}
The goal of this project is to apply with various high level control algorithms, in particular potential field based methods, for use in robotic convoys. With a priori knowledge of the kinetic models of the other robots in the convoy, the following robots will be able to determine the intended path and trajectory of their leader without the use of explicit communication. Kinematic and dynamic models were created for the robots. This allowed for the simulation of movement over rough terrain. The high level control algorithms will be implemented on several Khepera III platforms. The convoy used the robot model to traverse over simulated rough terrain.

The convoy followed their leader through the use of RGB-D sensors, and used the robot model to traverse over simulated rough terrain.
