\chapter{Conclusion}
This document outlined the development of a full control problem of a convoy of high speed robots over rough terrain. It presented the use of a Potential Fields algorithm to control the convoy, while generating a trajectory reference for the robots to follow. Assuming the availability of a priori kinetic models of the other vehicles in the convoy, the followers were able to determine the intended trajectory of their leader without the use of explicit communication.
