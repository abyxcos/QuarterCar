\chapter{Future Work}
As a continuation of this project, this work should be taken outside. R.C. cars appear to be a suitable device for a proper proof of concept. In particular, the Traxxas Stampede line\footnote{\url{http://traxxas.com/products/models/electric/3605stampede}} looks appealing, and several areas of this project were completed with this in mind. However, working outdoors brings a host of other concerns that were not addressed in this report. These are smaller platforms, and as such are not damped as much as a full sedan car. This will add a lot of noise into the system, even if it is modelable. In addition, There will be severe sensor saturation while in sunlight (even indirect.)
