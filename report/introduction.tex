\section{Introduction}
This project was inspired by searching for ways to control full-scale convoys. This application is commonly seen in military convoy driving, where a line of vehicles must follow each other while maintaining a safe and constant distance. For smaller vehicles, the advantage is the ability to gauge the path ahead, and avoid obstacles that the preceding vehicle failed to detect. In larger convoys, if the leader malfunctions, the convoy may continue unimpeded, rather than become trapped waiting for the leader to continue. However, there are plenty other applications including, but not limited to, transportation inside a factory.
