\section{Potential fields}
The goal of this project is to apply various high-level control algorithms, in particular potential field based methods, for use in robotic convoys driving at high speed over rough terrain. As an initial step, the following algorithm to control the convoy was developed and implemented on three Khepera III robots. The trajectory of motion was generated using a potential field algorithm.

Due to hardware limitations, the Khepera robots were only used to simulate the potential field control algorithm. The robotâs lack the ability to traverse rough terrain, therefore the high speed convoying and rough terrain navigation was simulated through MATLAB.

The potential field control algorithm was implemented in MATLAB. It is capable of successfully leading n-number of robots from the start position to the goal, assuming that the wheeled mobile robots move in the horizontal plane. The aim was to design a control law for n number of unconnected wheeled autonomous robots to follow a lead robots trajectory generated from the potential field algorithm, while maintaining a constant distance from each other. The control algorithm utilizes the potential field force equation \eqref{eq:potential_fields} to create a matrix of possible configurations for the movement of the robot. The robots' trajectories are defined by the following control equations:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:pot_lead}
	q_n=q+-K*F(q)q
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:pot_follow}
	q_{n(r)}=q_{(r+1)}-o
\end{equation}

Equation \eqref{eq:pot_lead} determines the lead robots next position ($q_n$) based on its current position ($q$) and the potential field force equation \eqref{eq:potential_fields}. The position $q$ and $q_n$ are 2x1 matrices of the form $[x y]^T$. The following robots' new positions ($q_{n(r)}$) are determined by equation \eqref{eq:pot_follow} for a simple leader-follower simulation. The offset from the lead robot ($q_{(r+1)}$) is $o$, a 2x1 matrix of the form $[x y]^T$ representing the straight-line $x$ and $y$ distance between the two robots.

In addition to a simple leader-follower simulation, a second simulation with a smoothing algorithm was implemented in MATLAB. The smoothing control algorithm accomplishes two goals; first, if a following robots leader disappears (i.e. breaks down) the follower becomes the leader and reaches its goal. Second, the following robots are able to follow a smoother trajectory to the goal. A smoother trajectory has less radical turns and directional adjustments required by the robot. The more follower robots, the smoother the final trajectory becomes. This algorithm uses these two equations for the follower robots:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:pot_follow_force}
	F(q) =
	\begin{cases}
		r=1, & -\nabla(U_a(q)+U_r(q) \\
		r>1, & -\nabla(q_{(r+1)}+U_r(q)
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:pot_follow_q}
	q_{n(r)}=q_r+-K*F(q)\dot{q}
\end{equation}

Equation \eqref{eq:pot_follow_force} uses the same potential field algorithm as the other simulation except for follower robots, where instead of the attractive field being assigned by the goal position; the attraction is defined by the robot's respective leader's position. For each time step, the robot's leader's position becomes the attractive force \eqref{eq:pot_follow_force} and a new position $q_{n(r)}$ is calculated based on it \eqref{eq:pot_follow_q}. Using this method, the following robots follow smoother trajectories because they react to the information learned by their leader about the terrain. It also solves the issue of a leader robot breaking down; the following robot becomes the new leader and successfully reaches the goal.

The Khepera III's that were used to impliment the potential fields simulation use the standard differential drive method. The kinematic equations for this type of robot are:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:diff_drive}
	\dot{x_i} &=& v_i(t)\cos\theta_i\\
	\dot{y_i} &=& v_i(t)\sin\theta_i\\
	\dot{\theta_i} &=& \omega_i(t)
\end{eqnarray}

where $(x_i,y_i)$ are the coordinates of the reference point of i-th robot in the Cartesian frame of reference. $\theta_i$ is its orientation angle with respect to the positive x-axis. $v_i$ and $\omega_i(t)$ are the linear and angular velocities, respectively.
